    "# Fake News Detection with TF-IDF and Logistic Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, I build a simple but effective text classification model to detect fake news articles. Fake news detection is a very relevant problem today, and I wanted to see how basic text processing and machine learning can be applied to a real dataset. Working on this project helped me go through the whole workflow, from cleaning the data to training a model and evaluating its performance.\n",

    "\n",
    "- Practice an end-to-end NLP pipeline (from raw text to predictions),\n",
    "- Understand how classical machine learning models behave on text data,\n",
    "- Explain each step in a clear and intuitive way, so that someone at my level can follow it."

    "\n",
    "1. loaded and combined fake and real news articles,\n",
    "2. cleaned the raw text with a simple NLP preprocessing function,\n",
    "3. converted the text into TF-IDF features,\n",
    "4. trained a Logistic Regression classifier,\n",
    "5. evaluated the model using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score and a confusion matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though I am still at a beginner level, this project shows that:\n",
    "\n",
    "- I can take a real-world problem,\n",
    "- turn it into a machine learning task,\n",
    "- and explain each step in a clear and structured way.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Possible next steps:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- try n-grams and other algorithms (LinearSVC, Naive Bayes),\n",
    "- experiment with modern transformer models such as BERT,\n",
    "- build a small app (e.g. with Streamlit) where users can paste a news article  \n",
    "  and get a fake/real prediction.\n",
